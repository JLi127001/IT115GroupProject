JavaScript makes webpages interactive. Other programing languages build the basic structure of the website and 
add features like changes color and font but they do not make them interactive.

JavaScript brings the website to life by allowing the user to interact with the website. Some examples are:
- Drop Down Menus
- Forms
- Animations
- Pop up boxes
- Interactive Maps
- Vidoes
