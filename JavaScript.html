<br>JavaScript makes webpages interactive. Other programing languages build the basic structure of the website and 
add features like changes color and font but they do not make them interactive. </br></br>

JavaScript brings the website to life by allowing the user to interact with the website. Some examples are:</br></br>
- Drop Down Menus</br>
- Forms</br>
- Animations</br>
- Pop up boxes</br>
- Interactive Maps</br>
- Videos</br>
- Games</br></br>
