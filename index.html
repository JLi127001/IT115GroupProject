  <!-- I am going to comment all this out, since we don't want it on the page itself, its just us thinking abt what we want to put.
       not sure of all of your html/css experience, so if you want to put in normal text, do this <p>text</p>, if you want bold text <h1>text</h1>(these go to 3,
       and the bigger the number, the smaller the text), for now that should be all that we need. 
  hello
  What could this project possibly be about? 
  We could do a project about cats or outdoor places to hike in the Northwest?
    - How to prepare for a hike?
      -(weather & trail conditions, water, first aid kit ect.) 
    - Easy beginner hikes?
    - More Advanced hikes?
    - What to do if you get lost/injured?
    - What is good food to pack while hiking?
