hello
What could this project possibly be about? 

We could do a project about cats or outdoor places to hike in the Northwest?
- How to prepare for a hike?
(weather & trail conditions, water, first aid kit ect.) 
- Easy beginner hikes?
- More Advanced hikes?
- What to do if you get lost/injured?
- What is good food to pack while hiking?
